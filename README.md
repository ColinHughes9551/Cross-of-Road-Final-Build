# Cross-of-Road-Final-Build
A clone of Crossy Road made in Unreal Engine 4
-Colin Hughes

-CPSC 386 Final Project (BENCHMARKS 3 AND 4)

-Unzip package and import .uproject file into UE4.

-Level "CROSS_OF_ROAD" is already set up to run the game.

-There is a slight chance the random spawning of trees and rocks will block the chicken at the start of the game, you will need to simply play the project again to correct this.

-You have full control of the chicken during the title card, and the title card will go away when you start moving forward.

-The game will restart shortly after dying.
